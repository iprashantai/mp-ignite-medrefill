**Harshith Ramesh:** Hey guys,  
**Arpit Jain:** It is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** morning.  
**Prashant Singh:** hi.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Merry Christmas. Sorry to be late here.

### 00:07:52

**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Was there there's a holiday,

**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** sick.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** It's it's a work holiday.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, it's on  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes.  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** holiday.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** How about today? Was today a holiday or no?  
**Arpit Jain:** No. Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** We have been working holiday.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** No.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Awesome. Cool. Sorry, I've been a little bit hard to get hold of.  
**Prashant Singh:** s\*\*\*.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** No problem.  
**Prashant Singh:** s\*\*\*.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** All right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** How did I can I start the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Um, I didn't get a chance. Yes, you're recording.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** recording?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I didn't get a chance. I was out all week. I didn't get a chance to review the refill stuff, but I guess we'll go through it now, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes,  
   
 

### 00:08:39

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay,  
**Arpit Jain:** sir.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** only one it because uh we have done certain things and it is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** great.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** important to talk to you as well before we take it further. Uh there are so to just give you little background right um after we discussed with you um I think it was important that we like you said it was important for us to understand the flow perspective of it really very well um and  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** uh I I I did see what you had done uh at certain level but it was important that we really understand from refill uh what happens stage by stage. So uh me and Arpatu uh had a lot of discussion, deliberation, lot of details going through these things and finally had come up with the process flow and uh the uh wireframe of it. Now um we will walk you through the flow first to make you first understand like or  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** from our side when I say understand not for you more for us subate is we understanding it rightly  
   
 

### 00:09:44

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** because uh you're more closer towards the industry and and possibly more closer to the process than  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** us whatever we have understood we have just understood from what we have read so uh that's  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** where we wanted to have this discussion first with you um and second just wanted to be when we're talking What MVP wanted to be mindful about not overcommitting or kind of doing everything possibly we we are like kind of thinking or we wanted to understand what where do we stop and where do we uh kind of do certain things Ashid because we don't want  
**Harshith Ramesh:** again  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** to kind of do too many things when we don't know about it as well when we don't know where it is in  
**Harshith Ramesh:** agree.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** so third based on this uh we I  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** feel uh we are largely We um I mean I working in a such a way that once we finalize this wireframe sit uh upon that we should be able to do certain things very quickly.  
   
 

### 00:10:49

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh when I say quickly I'm just thinking if it is going to be the way we think today tonight if it is simplified then I think we will be able to make it little better faster um for our 15th goal. Um uh that's the third thing and and um uh Prashant you certain things uh these are four things which of  
**Prashant Singh:** What is that?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** really happen harsh um now when we have worked on this via frame also  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** ensured certain best things at least from what I have understood I started creating  
**Prashant Singh:** All  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** which I'll also talk about the way I've started working uh harsh there's been a lot of learning for  
**Prashant Singh:** right.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Heat.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** me and I'm sure and pashant will also share their point of it. When I started working on this cloud core,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** uh like Indie 30 days back and what I'm doing right now are like completely different. When I say completely different, I have realized how I have to work with this right now and what I'm supposed to do,  
   
 

### 00:11:41

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** how sophisticated my prompts should be and uh what I should do, what I should not do. For example,  
**Prashant Singh:** I  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** now whenever I work, I say I have created a gold standard documents and I say the system that every time when I do something, it should go and update the gold standard document h and the knowledge repository and the checklist and every time when it finishes some of my prompts,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** it should ensure that that gold standard documents are QA as well so that it is not changing too many things every time. So I've created some standards the way I have been operating and working right now. Uh so these are learning sit and I'm only learning as I go. Um so I just wanted to keep you informed. The reason I'm telling this is sit uh because during my trial and error uh there are so many times I have lost information and I've come back again. I've tried to do certain things and it would be great also when there could be certain best practices which you are also following.  
   
 

### 00:12:41

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** If you could tell us we'll also be very sure when we are working certain  
**Harshith Ramesh:** for sure.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** things.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** And I and I imagine as we build more as we build more and more solutions, we'll figure out what these best practices are, right? I think so much right now in med is a little bit trial and error but 100% agree because I I think those best  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** practices I think those best practices adds to how we  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** differentiate ourselves against the legacy software developers  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right think about it the legacy software developers are trying to learn how to  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Absolutely. Absolutely.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** code and develop in the AI environment right that  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** learning period will take some time if we're already accomplishing that learning period right now.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** We're, you know, months or years ahead of them.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct. Absolutely. Harsh. Absolutely. For example,  
   
 

### 00:13:30

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I know that this is the right way. Right way of doing it, Ashit. For example, whenever I work on cloud code,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I also keep the Germany on my side. I make Germany as a CTO and I keep saying, okay, I did all of these things as a CTO of the company.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** What do you think about it? While I also do a lot of manual verification on things,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I take opinions in different ways and kind of implement those things. So, uh just thought I mean these are something which I've been doing. Hashid,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Great.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** but there's lot still to learn. Um having said that we we'll get on to the discussion.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Hashid first is the process flow. Arpit can we start with the process flow? And hash how much time do I did block you for three hours hashid but just wanted to check with  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I would at least for two hours and I'll figure it out after that.  
   
 

### 00:14:15

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** you. Okay,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** fair.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** At least two hours.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Um after this call if you have time possibly I just wanted to have some quick discussion with you but  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** uh we'll go ahead right now.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** that's  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Thank  
**Harshith Ramesh:** good.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** you.  
**Arpit Jain:** So uh hey hi Arishid. So before we move into the wireframes, so I just wanted to let you know our understanding of the process and what we are thinking about it so that we can take your inputs  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I have a question for you.  
**Arpit Jain:** and  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Hold on one second. Things here. When we think about the process flow,  
**Arpit Jain:** mhm  
**Harshith Ramesh:** do you want to think about it from a wait why is this? Sorry, my computer. Sorry, guys. One second.  
**Arpit Jain:** shots.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Um, I guess there's two ways to go about it. One is process flow like this. The other is going kind of page by page.  
   
 

### 00:15:12

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Maybe we'll go through this and we can think about the different pages of the application.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So we'll just quickly go through this uh and and then we'll in detail we'll walk through the wireframes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes. So uh hers how we are thinking is like there are two primary work list which is going to get created.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** One is going to be a refill work list and one is going to be a renewal work list. The difference being uh if the if the patient or the member has already a valid prescription in hand and they are just supposed to pick up the medicine from the pharmacy then it is will be called as a refill where we our primary motive is to make sure that that person is picking up the refill on time. So we are basically supposed to outreach so that they can they do it on time. That is the main thing for refill workflow. Renewal workflow like renewal work list is the are the cases where they their prescription is going to  
   
 

### 00:16:00

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** be invalid or they're going that there there's no no refill available on their prescription. this particular workflow the prescriber has to be involved uh where they will have a new  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** prescription coming in and and we need to make sure that that prescription is available to the person and they are taking that particular medicine on time. So these are the two  
**Harshith Ramesh:** You know I don't think so renewal work list. So let me think about this refilled worklist and are you thinking about this from a think about the app right now?  
**Arpit Jain:** H  
**Harshith Ramesh:** We have all patients we have a I think a refill work you think you're thinking two new two worklist a renewal worklist and a refill worklist.  
**Arpit Jain:** yes S. So we we would need to have two work list. One is refill, one is renewal. Uh right now we are working on the refill work list. We will will tell you like how refill and re almost could be the same.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I difficult question here right how should this is where I I wanted to talk to you is uh should we just focus at this point in time because you're talking about adherence should we just focus on the refill at this point in time harsh and and keep that renewal as our as our product to come  
   
 

### 00:17:19

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** later or do you think we should address both at this point in time  
**Harshith Ramesh:** We need to address both because one of the big things that had that started was on the renewal side.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** because  
**Harshith Ramesh:** It takes again 8 to 10 minutes to look through the protocols and do the renewal and that's one of the key things we're  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** trying to solve for,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay. Fair point.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** you know. Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Got it.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So I I see something here where I see renewal, refill, I see priority and fragility etc. down here. I want to think about this also as MA non medication adherence non-medication adherence. Right.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh yes. Yes. Hit. So what we thought hers maybe like even though if it is MA or non MA  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Right.  
**Arpit Jain:** definitely we'll prioritize MA and we'll prioritize how something will come into these worklist it will depend on like MA non MA and we can give priority according to that definitely but eventually both have to come right like if there is a reactive request coming in basically these work list so they  
   
 

### 00:18:17

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** they irrespective of them being MA or non MA we have to take action on that  
**Harshith Ramesh:** that's right.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think the way you prioritize them will be different, right? Or when you start work on them, right? Because if it's MA and you don't have any gap days remaining,  
**Arpit Jain:** correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** you may start work on it 10 days before, 14 days before.  
**Arpit Jain:** Exactly.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Whereas if it's non MA start only one or two days  
**Arpit Jain:** Exactly. Yeah, that that will depend definitely.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** before  
**Arpit Jain:** We'll include that here. So,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** And and generally the thumb rule has always been that when you get the request from the pharmacy then everything gets overridden which means that that pharmacy becomes the most important thing. uh because there is a reason why pharmacy is sending you the request. So whenever you're seeing anything coming from the pharmacy,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Again,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** the pharmacy will take precedence. It nothing else will take  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think I think it needs to be I think  
   
 

### 00:19:14

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** precedence.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** one of the things that was attractive to Wellma was the proactive nature of this of patients automatically flowing into the worklist based on their medications running out. Right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct. So if I want to give you an example,  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** let's take Neil's.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** That's That's the proactive scan. See the proactive scan. Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I see. I see. I see.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay. That makes  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So yeah, so we are saying if it is coming in proactive but still we got a request then you can see  
**Harshith Ramesh:** sense.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** that what I mean I'm sorry I'm taking it off from you Arpit.  
**Arpit Jain:** No,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I'm sorry for that. Trying to give a little background.  
**Arpit Jain:** not  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh is Ashit anytime when it is coming from somebody like a pharmacist or a member then we are just adding the priority further which means that it is only making more priority to it and they are saying you have to first work on this one because here is uh ARP's uh uh thing which has come you have to do it in next 14 days but we suddenly got a request for ARP from the pharmacy.  
   
 

### 00:20:22

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So we're going to add the priority by another 15 points base points. So it further improves to the ladder. So we are only making it better. But just wanted to check with you is this this thought what we are making makes  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So, let me think about the pharmacy request comes in and they're  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** sense.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** already in the So, think about this. Well, sorry. Let's go back one second to the green box, the renewal. Um, One thing I want to make the point on renewal is it doesn't necessarily need to go back to the clinician,  
**Arpit Jain:** H.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right? It could be the MA, meaning the medical assistant or the nurse practitioner or somebody else taking care of it because again, they can look at those protocols and the protocols are met. They can automatically prescribe it, right? And so make sure that that that renewal work workflow I don't think is as complicated  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** where it goes from you know um you see the request or you see it on the worklist and then it has to go through multiple approvals or go to a doctor I think is you see on the worklist you see the AI recommendation you say yes or no and then it it gets sent to the far and then it kind of goes like this say yes gets sent pharmacy no we figured out what The other exceptions  
   
 

### 00:21:41

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** are  
**Arpit Jain:** So basically they're saying if in case the MA itself is agreeing to  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** whatever the recommendations are and if they are all correct then it need not go to the prescriber eventually from there it can go to the pharmacy if in there is any issue.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** exact. Yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** Those cases only would be passed on to the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** exactly.  
**Prashant Singh:** Legally only a a doctor can renew a prescription,  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay.  
**Prashant Singh:** right? Hashid  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I don't you know the sense I got was the anyone in the clinic if it's an active prescription was able and based they met the protocols can renew the prescription and maybe it's again the MA is able to sign for the provider but it's an open  
**Prashant Singh:** Okay, cool. Mhm. Anyways, it would be a digital signature. I I guess as long as someone authorized clicks that sign button, the right digital signature would be used.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** That's  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So, uh,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right.  
**Arpit Jain:** hid what we're thinking about is irrespective of it being a refill or a renewal because in refill also we have to outreach to the patient so that they are picking up the medicine even before outreach we need to make sure that everything is going good with that patient for example I can't just outreach for example a week before that prescription is valid or not maybe that prescription has become invalid because he would have some some visit some somewhere right so before even reaching out I should be knowing about like whether everything is going good with this  
   
 

### 00:23:19

   
**Arpit Jain:** patient or not so what we were thinking irrespective of it being refill or a renewal. Refill output would be an outreach with the patient. Renewal output would be a valid prescription to the to the to the patient. Both we should first check and we should have our AI engine running and making sure that whoever is calling or whoever is taking the decision for a valid present should be uh equipped with that that all is good with the patient basically. So that's what we thought. Uh hash.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Hey,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I'm thinking about the outreach.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** What's the outreach for again? Let's say  
**Arpit Jain:** Refills like they have a valid prescription there but we believe that this person should be reached  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** out because their PDC is very low. So even though they have a valid prescription their refill is going to come in 10 days. It's a valid prescription. They just they can just go and pick up the medicine. But we need to call them make sure that they taking their medicines on time.  
   
 

### 00:24:16

   
**Arpit Jain:** They are picking up the medicines on time.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** picking up the It's after the refill goes in. After the after the prescription goes  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh yeah for example let's suppose I am uh I have a I'm going to the doctor there is a  
**Harshith Ramesh:** in.  
**Arpit Jain:** new prescription I have three refills valid right uh right now so on 30 days supply  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** so I can go after every 30 days three times and I can get the medicines so there is no pres prescriber involvement needed anywhere so those I'm calling refills and once that prescription expires like those three refills are out. That's what I'm calling renewals where the prescriber is going to again needs to be involved. Now I'm saying I need to make sure that particular person is taking the medicine like three times on time as well right because gap days are going to be created there as well if they miss out.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So I am supposed to outreach those particular patients which are not doing good which is where PDC is 79% 78% we need to make sure they are taking the medicine on time for them also before I outreach like please make sure you take your medicine on time your refill is going to be due by this date please raise a request or like go to the pharmacy I need to make sure everything is good with that patient correct before I do an outreach  
   
 

### 00:25:34

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** wouldn't that be remember we had that which wasn't built out yet the compliance workless piece which is medication compliance are you taking the medications um make reminders to take the medication. Reminders or getting information if there's any  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Right.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** issues.  
**Arpit Jain:** So uh so that will be taken care by this refill workflow. Basically what we are telling is for example  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** That's where I think I'm uh Can you repeat it, Hash one more time? What you said, Hashid?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So I think there's another worklist called medication compliance worklist  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** and all that worklist is it's outreach or chat bots that are reminding you to take your medication number one remind you take your medication getting feedback from you are you taking your medication so one is arpa they want to remind you uh you need to take this pill once a day and then four days later says hey ara I want to check with you in the last you know four days have you taken every day or taking two days, one day, three days.  
   
 

### 00:26:40

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** So, you have feedback on compliance. And then three, I think it would be feedback on any kind of issues or if it says, hey, listen, I'm only taking one out on four days and I'm having stomach stomach issues because of it, right? And so I think that gets taken care of through the compliance worklist agent let's say is what is what I was thinking because if you if you keep refill renewal clean where all it is any outreach related to this  
**Arpit Jain:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** is simply if I if the refill or if the prescription's been sent it's reminders to get the refill pick it up or if there's a reason we can't do a refill because you haven't been to the doctor's office in 12 months or 6 months. It goes to a different workflow where you're scheduling the doctor the visit and so on.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Harsh I think uh we should just go through this flow harsh little down so that uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** we just you just point us where uh I kind of understood what you have said about this medical compliance thing  
   
 

### 00:27:42

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** but what we have done is hers you have put everything within this refill system  
**Arpit Jain:** Sure.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** itself and uh I I I let's go through it a little bit hashid and then again pass your feedback on what you think about it. The way we are seeing  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh so uh as as uh we discussed the patient is going to enter work list they  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** it  
**Arpit Jain:** can enter via proactive or reactive. Proactive is basically our system scanning through and based on some configurations obviously uh they will come into  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** this worklist or we can receive requests from the pharmacy or the member and it will be it will come via SH script or like any other mode of communication right now. So two modes now how it is going to be come is basically depend on the priority and the fragility which we have already discussed on the uh on the all patient CRM. So I'll not go through into the detail here and how it is going to route to different worklist whether  
   
 

### 00:28:38

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** it is a refill or a renewal. It depends on the how many refills are pending for that particular prescription. If it is zero then renewal more than zero refill here we need to do an outreach here we need to do a valid  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** prescription uh new prescription basically.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** Now once that's once uh this particular member comes in member plus medication comes into this particular worklist our validation engine is going to run which is going to validate uh if there is a duplicates if eligibility issue whether all those things that is first first check I'm going to do and all these checks is are basically going to include in this AI clinical review only here we have just shown it separately so that basically it will if I'm receiving via pharmacy and something is proactive active it will match. If there is a duplicate it will throw into another exception where the user can take a decision like they can merge the request basically uh based on the member name and the the drug uh which for which the requests have come from two different places.

**Arpit Jain:** So those duplicates issues would be resolved there.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** If there is an eligibility problem it will directly move to a eligibility queue which is going to be a queue worked upon later. I I'll discuss those cues later. So we have we have come up with different different clinical cues, eligibility cues, PAQs, duplicate cues where any issue is coming up. Those will be part into these exception cues. This is one one if we club all together one we call it exception Q.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** Then our AI is going to run the primary QA and the manager three tier AI which we are talking about here  
**Harshith Ramesh:** What is What is the AI looking for?  
**Arpit Jain:** also.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** AI is looking for the  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** protocols.  
**Arpit Jain:** Protocols and the clinical everything.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Everything what you have defined as what we are using Arshid.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** We are not creating any new engine here. We're just exactly using your same engine which you have called it as Yi Q manager.  
   
 

### 00:30:30

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** That's the engine which is running here.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** make  
**Arpit Jain:** So once AI does their job, it will be ready for the user action.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** sense.  
**Arpit Jain:** So this is this is going to be the ideally be the first touch for a user. Like here the user will see okay what AI has done. They will review the decision decision whether to approve, modify or deny. We'll go into the detail in the in the wireframes above these things. But this is going to be where the human is going to be involved first time in the whole workflow. Then because it is a refill workflow uh the output if I if user agrees that whatever AI  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** has done is correct the user don't have any problems everything is good then it will be move to the outreach. Now outreach here we are saying it is going to be we can we can automate the outreach as well like send SMS.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** just uh zoom in one one or two clicks just the zoom.  
   
 

### 00:31:28

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** that's great. Thank you.  
**Arpit Jain:** So once the user reviews and it identifies everything is good with the patient, we can initiate an outreach sequence for these patients. We can initiate an automated outreach where on the first day SMS will be sent and the chatbot or like the email or the IVR we can take a decision like how to initiate that outreach sequence for such patients so that it is continuously not continuously but it is making sure that patient is supposed to pick up the medicine on time like whenever the we will we will tell them your refill is going is pending on this particular date please make sure that you raise a request before uh maybe this particular date or you go to the pharmacy on mistake of or is there a mail order then accordingly uh action would be taken but here we are  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** just going to outreach we are not going to take any action here basically most mostly we are thinking it would be automated outreach only but there could be some cases where manual outreach is needed if in case there is any  
   
 

### 00:32:24

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** issue like we need to immediately reach out to the patient so that that person should not like ideally should not take the refill if in this case there is any issue but 90 95% of the time hers this is going to be a good happy path only here.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Now during the contact with the patient if there is any issue any barrier which comes in for example pharmacy I have changed the pharmacy like I I'm into another state now I need my I need my refills here or there is a cost barrier ideally in refill cost barrier would not come but we are keeping this because renewal also we are saying it is going to be the same concept basically overall so it's a cost barrier transport barrier  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** if there any clinical issues uh if the patient declines I don't want this medicine or like we are not able to reach out to the patient so if there is any barrier coming in while the contact we are making then accordingly it will route to different cues basically for example is pharmacist which is  
   
 

### 00:33:31

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** detected then what we are supposed to do uh those things and system will daily monitor these patients and when I say monitor it is going to monitor ideally the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** claims that whether RX fill has come up for these patients or not. My refill was ending on this particular date for example on 26th of December. Ideally I should have my uh medicines with me by 24th or 25th maybe 24th of December.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** I daily system will daily monitor if the refill comes in no issues uh it will be out of my work list. If the refill does not come in that's when I'm going to escalate and I'm going to move this to manual people calling them. Why have you not still picked up your medicines? Now the only issue here Ash which we feel is should we rely on claims?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** I don't know how frequently I'm going to update my claims or like I'm going to get the claims data. Uh that is one risk which we are seeing here like uh how would we know the the patient has picked up the medicine?  
   
 

### 00:34:35

   
**Arpit Jain:** Is claim the only information?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** If that is there then we have we need to make sure we are updating almost on a daily basis the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Right.  
**Arpit Jain:** claims and once the fill is detected it's a happy path everything is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** closed patient moves out the out of the work list and it will come in whenever the refill is going to expire. This is a happy path. Now again if it is an exception how to process them that we have like these different cues which are which we talked  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** about if man if different requests are coming from different places how to handle those requests whether to merge or we give priority to such requests which is coming from multiple places or user can take action that that is not actually duplicate the system is identifying duplicate wrongly here if it comes to a clinical queue where labs are out of  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** range vitals are concern there is some DDI some contra indication anything any clinically issue comes up those type of work list items will be parked under into this queue where the pharmacist is going to have some SLA where they are going to resolve that issue and move on basically similarly PAQ again any prior authorization Q again  
   
 

### 00:35:40

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** refill it won't be a problem totally agree but just we are keeping it because renewal also we are  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** we we are all discussing about refill renewal So that's why keeping keeping everything just so as to we cover  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** everything here. So all these prior authorization issues will come here. Person who is responsible for that will come into this queue will uh see everything resolve the issue. Once the issue is resolved it will then flow into our main worklist again and from there uh everything will be closed out. Similarly scheduling queue if I need to make any visits I need to schedule any visit. Uh similarly eligibility Q which we already discussed if the patient is inactive or like cannot enrolled or there is any issue with the wrong health plan. So any mismatches or like any data issues coming in this will flow here and accordingly these so what what we are trying to do hers is we are trying to see what all use cases are possible once a user enters into the worklist it has to be  
   
 

### 00:36:42

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** closed and it can go by different different flows. So we are just trying to see what all flows are possible. Some flows might not be possible in the refills but could be possible in the renewals.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So we're trying to cover everything. Now this we have discussed only the refill right now in this particular workflow. The only change which is going to happen for uh yes N you're saying  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** But yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** something.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** but largely Arshett if you see this is my gut feeling that we are keeping the system same for both refill and uh renewals largely the same. It's just that like Arpit said there are certain cases where it will be very specific for renewables for many cases it will be specific for refills. So the processes are same it's just that it will take itself decisions where when it is renewal what it needs to do accordingly. Uh that's what we we feel harsh this is this is how we've defined the system on the flow.  
   
 

### 00:37:44

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Um and Arpit do you want to show the wireframe first?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes. Just this one thing here in the refill workflow we are having outreach sequence after a user takes a  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Oh,  
**Arpit Jain:** like good like approved decision in renewal it is going to be a new RX that's the only change we are expecting.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yep.  
**Arpit Jain:** Now moving on to the uh to the wireframes. So this is what we came up with hers where we are talking about these different cues how  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** heat.  
**Arpit Jain:** the how it is going to enter into the worklist and move into this different different cues from here.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** But what what we did actually is rather than going to this workflow, we actually compared what you have also done on your end and we tried to make changes according to that particular that particular screen. So rather than going into the detail in this particular wireframes, there are there are something goods here but good good things here but we'll we'll go through this particular wireframe where it is  
   
 

### 00:38:36

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** somewhat matching with the uh with the UI and UX and the the one which you had on your  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** h. So uh to give you brief again  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Is this our understanding correct before we jump into this wireframe part of it  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think you're  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** that you have sorry you say something? So uh there is uh a step before here it is happening  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** where we are looking at the PDC we're looking at at everything now the data is going to flow into this right harsh where we are supposed to follow the refills now question one which I have before we jump into into anything here is this list which you're going to see are we only expected to see for those ones where we are looking at that salvage T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 part of it. Are we supposed to consider only those ones which we need to be really looking at it here or are we supposed to even look at ones where the PDC scores are pretty good like they are in like 90% or 90 and above or also some things which we are supposed to bring into the monitoring system here because uh that would be a very important point right because if you don't want the ones which is already doing well and we are not so worried about those ones Do we wanted to bring it up here or we don't want to bring it up  
   
 

### 00:40:14

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think we'll want to bring everything up here, right? Anything that needs refill renewal,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** here?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** we'll want to bring up just the prioritization of how you work through the queue is changed based on uh based on medication adherence priority. I think I think that's the way it should be, right? It should be every because why wouldn't you why wouldn't you bring it up  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay. No, I I'll give you that reason.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** here?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** This this is where I think our understandings are sometimes are like reading the articles only harsh I don't know for example it is you harsh you've been very uh much 100% in the way  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** you are kind of always picking up your refill now my understanding is even if I bring it up you in this queue uh I'm not going to do anything about it it's just that it is there in this queue but for example Arpit is somebody who is not doing very well in his numbers or he's at a point where he's between the salvage an unsalvaged thing we possibly just  
   
 

### 00:41:11

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Heat.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** work those person alone here and not too much focus on hashidl like person because you are already always coming and picking up your medicines on the time uh is what my understanding was hashid that's why I wanted at least from the refill point of it now renewal you're right everybody and everybody we need to look into that point of it but refill do you think that is re really reasonably required that we are supposed to look into everybody actually because it's a practice that you're supposed to come and pick up the medicines from the uh uh medical shop. Is that not our understanding correct hash?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** But you have to close the loop, right? That I picked actually picked it  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** up.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** that I'm going to anyway get it from the claims right hash I that this has got picked up do I need to monitor them is what I'm asking uh like should  
**Harshith Ramesh:** What do you mean by monitor?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** should we sit and possibly I'll should we really sit and do should this AI system everything should run and should it be somewhere here we keep checking them or we should just say that uh we will put them under directly and that monitor monitoring Qashid directly to say that he just got the medicines there.  
   
 

### 00:42:25

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** For example, if Hashid is is damn good and his PDC is like 100% always, should I just directly put you under that monitoring queue which I have created Hashid where I will just check for your claims has come or not? I will not do much uh of calling you looking at barriers  
**Harshith Ramesh:** But why is there any why is there any calling?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** everything.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Why is there any calling done? When you say call, like if I'm in this review queue, what what do you do? What does the user do?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, that I think that a then possibly I'll be able to explain this.  
**Arpit Jain:** Sure sure.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Arit. Do you want to just open up one example?  
**Arpit Jain:** So this is the re refill worklist. All the patients which we are moving from all patient CRM to here will be available on this review screen. when it is there in review screen it means that their days left is less than let's  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** say 14 days whatever is configurable like 14 days or 10 days according to their fragile leakage and  
   
 

### 00:43:20

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** everything those patients will come up here and these patients the AI would have already run and they would have already given you how like this confidence score we are going to remove give the confidence score but whatever the output whether it is approving denying or whatever it is doing now these are the protocol checks which we are which we are planning to have like some basic validations, clinical checks, safety checks, coverage issues everything and the user can take a decision here whether they agree with the AI uh like the output which it is coming up whether to escalate basically they do not agree and there is some modification which they want to do for this particular patient or there is a rare chance of denying this refill to the patient because the patient has called and said that I'm not going to become medicine like any any other reason.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** So if I go ahead and approve this particular thing here there could be what I what I will do there are options available whether I want this part particular person to move to a particular outreach for example let's suppose this patient is not doing well it is on 75% PDC and last two refills uh that person has missed to take on time let's suppose so AI is going to recommend I am going to move this to manual call because I need to make sure I'm reaching out to this patient,  
   
 

### 00:44:46

   
**Arpit Jain:** understand their problem and make sure that this person is picking up the medicine on this on time this time around or if my patient is doing really good it is already 99% adherent and my refills are happening right on time then it will no outreach needed it will directly move to monitoring just we need to track the pickup that's it and if there are some some somewhere in the middle where there are 95% 90% so AI is going to recommend you can move them to auto outreach where SMS and reminders are going to send to them so that they they know that they are supposed to pick up the medicine and they pick up the medicine on time. So that's what we are thinking hash  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Is that right? As is what we are thinking at this  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I'm think I'm thinking about it.  
**Arpit Jain:** every.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Let's do this. Let's work through one flow at a time.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** point.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So, like renewal. Let's work through renewal first, not refill. Okay. We work through renewal.  
   
 

### 00:45:39

   
**Arpit Jain:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** um you have these this list that's proactively created, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** And forget about we got to think through um duplicates inbound, but let's just say, you know, within 14 days of renewal required, you end up on the list,  
**Arpit Jain:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** The AI will then look at all of your um EMR data plus the protocols required and make a determination. Right? And that it'll do that it'll do that on its own.  
**Arpit Jain:** Credit  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Right? The question then is how does this list in terms of priority number one through n show up on my screen? Right?  
**Arpit Jain:** correct correct correct harsh.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** priority,  
**Arpit Jain:** So how this so this would be based on the urgency like which we decided right.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So, this shows this shows up in my list as some priority, right? And then I need to I will then go through it in priority order.  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay, let's take the happy path.  
   
 

### 00:46:46

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** The happy path is um I approve the AI, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** If I approve the AI, the question is what happens next?  
**Arpit Jain:** So  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Um one the script the RX gets written  
**Arpit Jain:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right and sent right and number  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct. Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** two so RX is written and sent and then number two a outreach let's say an outreach protocol begins or work or or workflow  
**Arpit Jain:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** begins right the question is what does that outreach  
**Arpit Jain:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Each workflow look  
**Arpit Jain:** So for renewal what I thought hers is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** like  
**Arpit Jain:** if we approve if happy path if the person approves it here RX would be sent I thought it will directly move to the monitoring queue saying that uh like this refill is going to be available for this patient and we are supposed to monitor them if they're picking that particular medicine on time or not.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** you moved him.  
**Arpit Jain:** You are And you're saying we can initiate an outreach sequence  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
   
 

### 00:47:57

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** as well like kind of a reminder saying that uh your pres prescription is going to be uh run out maybe in like 10 days so you are supposed to pick up the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I don't know. I don't know if I think we have to merge and this is what I done f uh outreach and  
**Arpit Jain:** medicine.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** monitoring into just a fill queue, right? is if I have a protocol if I have let's have a outreach protocol which says AI chatbot on day zero day one day two day three and then escalated to voice on day four and day six or whatever. I think that's just working that fill cue. I don't think that I don't think the outreach and the monitoring queue are  
**Arpit Jain:** for renewal.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** different.  
**Arpit Jain:** I agree hash like uh for renewal definitely I agree to you that for renewal it will directly go to this particular uh section which is like fill and it is going to monitor in the next one day whether I is picked up in the next like 5 days 7 days and if it is not picked up till that then it will be an escalation and we are going  
   
 

### 00:49:18

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** If you go to um the idea of my UI open by chance or able to  
**Arpit Jain:** to uh give me one second let me  
**Harshith Ramesh:** get  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I can I have open  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah, need if you can  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** questions.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** just to remind myself  
**Arpit Jain:** sh  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I should actually Yeah, but I I'll hear it. I had a reason why I go ahead.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So if you're getting picked up,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Sorry.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** think about think about this as a human, you have this cue of pickup, right? Like basically the script has been written. I need to make sure that my my script gets picked up. I think the outreach piece feels I don't know why I don't know why the outreach whether it's separate out why outreach and monitoring are separate because you can be I think what you mean by monitoring I think monitoring is I'm not sending you any kind of outreach I'm just waiting to see  
**Arpit Jain:** There are two two things Harsh one is I will not outreach you I'll just wait for  
   
 

### 00:50:41

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** right Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** it second is if I outreach you and you tell me okay I'm going to pick up  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** the medicine on this date I will move them to monitoring if I'm not able to reach out to the patient I'll try two times or maximum three times if I'm able to do that's okay if I'm not able to do eventually it can move to monitoring only because I'm not able to reach out to the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think it's over complicated because I think ultimately the status is the same which  
**Arpit Jain:** patient  
**Harshith Ramesh:** is medication has been written medication has not been picked up.  
**Arpit Jain:** return and not picked  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Written and not picked up.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct. Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** The only thing which I was the reason why we I kind of I mean initially we just have it as uh only three like you did it harsh. The reason I came to a point when we started working on it is when I was just seeing the screen I was not able to differentiate what you said arship pickup versus uh thing right so uh the the screen possibly I wasn't very convinced that it was telling me which one should I today really monitor for pickup which one am I supposed to monitor for things which still not got picked up uh what I meant by that is harsh there  
   
 

### 00:51:59

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean, I think I think that would I think that would be filters,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** are Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right? Filters and views because again, if what does it mean to be in the outreach queue?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** What does that mean is a question.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So, Harit to be in the out.  
**Arpit Jain:** So sorry.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So we actually talked about the refill workflow renewal.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Go ahead.  
**Arpit Jain:** I agree like what we are saying  
**Harshith Ramesh:** say the renewal. Let's say the renewal right now.  
**Arpit Jain:** definitely  
**Harshith Ramesh:** If what's it what's what does it mean to be in the outreach workflow for renewal  
**Arpit Jain:** for renewal.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** workless?  
**Arpit Jain:** I think I agree to what you're saying. uh it should be in the monitoring itself and uh if in there if in case there is some issue it will uh it will prompt you to make a call or like make a escalation basically there if if there if the refill is not of the renewal is not picked up maybe in seven days escalate like like  
   
 

### 00:52:58

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** that Neil what are your thoughts like for renewal u that's what I  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Hey,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. I think to to me because I think the outreach I think to me outreach and monitoring is the same in some ways, right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Sorry.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** It's a system that on its own just figures out do I need to what do I what do I need to do with it? Right? Do I just sit still wait or do I has to sort of have some sort of outreach? Um I'm thinking now if it's escalated here and maybe I think it's statuses within pickup, right? I think it's um as you get deeper into not being picked up. So, you know, 7 to 10 days, 10 to 14, etc. Your escal outreach method changes and I think it's all just incorporated in in one work list.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. So we can just you're saying we can keep on monitoring into the same system will keep on monitoring into the same queue itself and will prompt you if in case uh and they can change the outreach method as well based on like at what  
   
 

### 00:54:40

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** or go to go to the renewal work. The one above, not the new the old one. No. Yeah, right there. Yep.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** This  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, this one above above.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** one.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So, I think like here where you have this fill tracking RX, no fill. I think like that's the kind of kind of filtering you use in that monitor or in that fill queue. And the AI then automatically knows what the because think about it a no fill three to seven days outreach looks different if it's med drug and you have high fragility versus if it's a non-mederence drug. Right? If you have high fragility metadherence, no fill three to seven days, you may get multiple chatbot SMSs on day one and two and then phone escalation on day three. Whereas non-medication heroes, you may not get a phone, you may not get get anything. You may get one maybe a one chatbot a day. That's it. and no voice,  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes, I should definitely It will depend on the Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:55:59

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Arpit Jain:** on on the patient and the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean, if you go back to go to go way down here um on the left side,  
**Arpit Jain:** uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** say so much uh down to the tools.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, I should tell  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Go say where it says metrics reference on the left on the left menu bar.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** you.  
**Arpit Jain:** uh in the in the tools bar uh like on the left hand side. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, metrics reference then  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** click uh no actually go to help go to help and documentation. Go up. Um is that here? No. So try try metrics reference again.  
**Arpit Jain:** Oh my god.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Good decision framework. Yeah. Go down. Uh down. Yeah. This this priority matrix, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** H.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Have you seen this? So, I think depending on where you are on this matrix,  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** your outreach would look different, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** correct answer.  
   
 

### 00:57:17

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** And so if you're and then if and then if you're I mean I guess if you're kind of like non-medication here you're probably just like on this watch list but you know if you're let's say you're on this watch list section and you're and your renewal has been filled but not picked up. You may just get a SMS chatbot SMS daily. All right. And I want to make sure we we we define the difference between a automated SMS versus an AI chatbot SMS, right? Something that you can actually chatbot that you can actually interact with versus just an automated reminder. And maybe we maybe  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So you're saying anything anything in the watch you just filter it out and say to the chatbot just send their  
**Harshith Ramesh:** use  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** services. Is that what I'm thinking?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. to me I think um well it's days medic like yeah so if let's let's say you have 0 to seven days of medication left but then you have 30 plus gap days left right you may just send them a message like every day or every other  
   
 

### 00:58:41

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** day  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I  
**Prashant Singh:** You say hers the AI enabled message where they can chat.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** understand.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Right.  
**Prashant Singh:** Did you mean we give them a link where if they click the the chat opens either if you have an app or a web  
**Harshith Ramesh:** That's a good question, Pashant.  
**Prashant Singh:** app  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I don't know. I mean, could we do it just through us? I mean, one thing we think about is like patient safety because what if the chatbot kind of goes off the rails?  
**Prashant Singh:** certainly  
**Harshith Ramesh:** But I think but I think I want to have some level of intelligence of the  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** chatbot can ask maybe the right next questions of can you pick up the medications? Why have you not picked it up yet? And be able to get information. I I want to be careful. It's not like a wide open chatbot where you know the patient can trick it into giving you medical advice,  
**Prashant Singh:** Well, certainly. Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:59:46

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** But but if um the patient says, "Hey, I have stopped taking medication in the last two weeks because it's giving me an upset stomach." The chatbot can can understand that and cue it correctly. So then you're out of the then you're out of this worklist and you're into the exceptions worklist,  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah. s\*\*\*. Somewhere we'll have to also protect PHI as well. So we'll probably uh also see what should be the scope  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** of data that the chat box will have access to. So it is also able to answer as well as not disclose some of the notes desired information. So the question was also Ashad obviously uh as of today the normal SMS does not support um chat. Okay so you meant that via SMS the normal SMS application itself the chatting should happen or you meant we give them a link and they click on it. So either we have Ignite Health Android application or they get routed to a web web app.  
   
 

### 01:01:06

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** the web app,  
**Prashant Singh:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Prashant Singh:** until we have the Android app, right? Or obviously or or iOS,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** whatever.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yep.  
**Prashant Singh:** So you did not mean to have a ongoing conversation through the normal SMS application. You  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean can I mean if it's possible to have conversation SMS application it's probably better  
**Prashant Singh:** meant  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right don't you think and I wonder if we think about  
**Prashant Singh:** Sure.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** like kind of road map here and and MVP is you know step one or is SMS automated automated SMS messages automated SMS reminders meaning there's no intelligence it's just saying Harpath or pashant your medication is ready like you know I get let me see the last one I  
**Prashant Singh:** Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** got  
**Prashant Singh:** Anyways, I think I should probably we can brainstorm more when we prioritizing this feature. Right. For now, you're saying probably it's just one way information or communication, right?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I one  
**Prashant Singh:** Or  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
   
 

### 01:02:18

   
**Prashant Singh:** sorry for derailing your other conversation. Yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I don't know.  
**Prashant Singh:** please.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I was looking at these prior um  
**Prashant Singh:** Come on. Come  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, I get this automated message. Hi,  
**Prashant Singh:** on.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** your prescription is ready to refill. Here's your link to check out.  
**Prashant Singh:** Cool.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I'll send you a copy of this. It's through. Hold on. Gift health. Look at the gift health app. Hey, give health is actually pretty good. Our solutions access and intake pharmacy and fulfillment,  
**Prashant Singh:** Sure.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** but they're also so  
**Prashant Singh:** Look at it. Yeah. And so just try to infer from your conversation with Arpid and Neil.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Anyway,  
**Prashant Singh:** Uh are you suggesting that we have just one queue where probably the status determines what is the next action for each of these people based on obviously the the profile and the status instead of creating separate cues have probably a single queue but and and  
   
 

### 01:04:00

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** different views of yours. Yeah, it's the same.  
**Prashant Singh:** and have them prioritize based  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Hopefully, it's the same  
**Prashant Singh:** on the urgency. See,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** queue.  
**Prashant Singh:** as long as it's the same sort of user that is going to work, you're saying let's have the same queue, same user profile uh based ordered based on the priority. Obviously, actions would differ based on the need of the person.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yes.  
**Prashant Singh:** So Q should be determined based on the user type, not based on the patient type, I guess.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean, I think that's when you say user type. What do you  
**Prashant Singh:** I mean the user profile if if are we going to have just one user persona or multiple user  
**Harshith Ramesh:** mean?  
**Prashant Singh:** persona if it's the same uh like a clinician or or a staff if it's the same profile person who is going to act on two different items then instead of creating two different cues we have just one Q and prioritize them accordingly. So he does not need to jump across multiple cues rather just one Q is sufficient and he's giving his attention to the most important or urgent  
   
 

### 01:05:13

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** But that's still we can manage it within the same screen  
**Prashant Singh:** one.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** itself. You just give I I think we we've done that in the current UI. I can show it if you want. For example, there is this C care coordinator and pharmacist. Uh example, I'm just saying a care coordinator cannot approve it or only a pharmacist can approve it. So uh the queue remains the same just that you have two different uh role here for somebody.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, I think  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. The view is the same.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think it's right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. All right.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Sorry, one  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Excellence.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Hey guys,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So I should I kind of understand this part very well right now right?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** sorry.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh but uh so did I understand this correctly hersid? So you're saying when it comes to renewal is this flow we are building in for refill all we just need to do is just to monitor by just checking their medical compliance check  
   
 

### 01:07:07

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think I think the refill I  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** and  
**Harshith Ramesh:** think the refill has a I think what I think I think the refill is similar except instead of rewriting the script you're just sending the pharmacy a reminder. I think I got I got to double check that because if you go back to the renewal, go back to the worklist  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** like this. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** and then let's let's say you know you approve this all these protocol  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** checks. I think you have the same approval process except instead of when you approve for a renewal, you're writing back to the EMR to rewrite a script. Here, I think you're just resending the script or reminding the pharmacy to fill it. Maybe it's a fill request versus a  
**Arpit Jain:** So Har we just wanted to check that like whether we should so we  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** are definitely reminding the patient to make sure that they're picking up their medicine on time. So should we also send the reminder to the pharmacy as well so they they keep the uh like medication ready or like uh  
   
 

### 01:08:30

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think so.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** The the reason I I wanted to understand that a little bit more is Sashid because whatever I have read I mean  
**Arpit Jain:** okay  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** again my understanding is only based on the reading sits that the adherence is as equally important for the pharmacist to also to do it correctly. So they are also looking at this adherence percentage in some way and they're always reaching to the patients already. So my question is would it not kind of somewhere duplicate this whole process of we are also reaching to the uh uh I I don't know should we reach to the member or should we reach to the pharmacist uh what should be that process when we are talking about refill hers once we feel that okay this is good everything has got approved should we confirm it to the pharmacist or should we say to the uh patients that you come and pick it  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, let me pose that. Let me ask let me ask the one my team  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** refill.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** because that determines what we are supposed to do in the refill harsh because uh I somehow feel after talking to you refill seems to be very straightforward right hashid it should be very simple that we get into this I believe that most of the time refill  
   
 

### 01:09:43

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** should be mostly approved like Arpit said shouldn't have much to deny because it is already going through in a sequence already. So uh people are coming and either picking up mostly there could be differences.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Heat.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I'm not saying but that should be like I don't know what should be that percentage of I don't have a number here.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, let me do this.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh and uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Let me let me email you guys right now.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Sorry. One second, guys. Just while while I have you guys, it's easier to send the email out, right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** sure. That will be very helpful.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Um, new reopite one. Perfect. very different scenarios. There we go. for you. Um, my patient does not have any refills. And that when it finishes a protocol check must be administered and a new RX must be written pharmacy can confirm in the case where a patient has refills remaining.  
   
 

### 01:12:57

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** What are you reading? Sorry, my son is here with me. Um okay then in the case where pat example the doctor gave three refills what's the process there Um second then in the case where a patient sorry hasn't like slow to type has refills remaining  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** God bless  
**Harshith Ramesh:** what's there when meds begin to  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** you.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** run out since there is Already refills remaining. Does that mean protocols don't need to be checked again? Check again. What's your process? I do just call pharmacy. Appreciate the help. Hopefully the questions make sense. Thanks. All right, guys. I just sent this email out. I copied you. Ignite one at health.ai. Um, since there are already what's what's your process? Anything else? Okay. All right, guys. Give me five minutes. You take like a little I just sent an email out. You take a quick five minute break.  
   
 

### 01:15:36

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** All right.  
**Arpit Jain:** expressions.  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I'm gonna grab a coffee and then get my sunset and I'll come back.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Prashant Singh:** thank you.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Ch.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** renewal is then is it so very simplified that we are only checking for medical compliance check which is like if I understanding hers well he's saying did somebody take the medicine like if you remember um we sending SMS and getting an confirmation that you did not miss there isn't any allergic for you or anything like that,  
**Arpit Jain:** So,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** right?  
**Arpit Jain:** so the renewal remains exactly as it is Neil like there is no change at all like what what we discussed refill just that the output is going to be RX sent I think that is the uh only change I see right now between refill and the renewal everything else everything remains the same actually.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** No, but why do you even read outreach in refill zit?  
**Arpit Jain:** So in the refills I want to do outreach.  
   
 

### 01:17:22

   
**Arpit Jain:** Uh it's the same thing actually like both in both the cases I need to make sure that the patient is making taking their medicines on time and the pharmacies are ready with the either the valid prescription and the medicines or only just the medicines.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Who are we referring to here? Right? Is it going to be pharmacist or is it going to be  
**Arpit Jain:** So that's what Harit said like uh he will double confirm but we might need to initiate  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** members?  
**Arpit Jain:** intimate the pharmacy as well so that they can keep the medication ready like for the patient but that he will  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. But again going back to the same  
**Arpit Jain:** confirm  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** question renewals comes protocols happens this seems to be perfectly fine. Uh in case of refills remember you and me had discussed that uh the patients mostly come by themsel and pick it up right.  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct. Correct.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh so in this case what are we supposed to do that uh anytimes when a  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct.  
   
 

### 01:18:31

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** refills are coming it comes into this queue where we are saying everything is fine we approve them and um and we send it to for a moment let's assume it is going to  
**Arpit Jain:** Hey,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** be pharmacist and we send it to pharmacist But like I said, pharmacists also already having they know that they're supposed to do this, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** correct. Correct. That's why we thought that we might not in intimate pharmacy because uh they already would  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So  
**Arpit Jain:** have we just need to make sure patient is picking it up on time. So yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So in refill as we discussed mostly 95% of the time ideally again not sure about the numbers but everything should we just need to monetize basically and we just need to uh do outreach based on the the the fragility and the urgency uh uh basically we just need to decide what type of outreach do we need to do whether we need to send the im message Correct.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Don't even need to think about this barriers and other things you're  
   
 

### 01:19:54

   
**Arpit Jain:** If in case we identify any barriers during this outreach then we have to  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** saying.  
**Arpit Jain:** definitely take action. That is one thing. Plus before the refill if we identify any issues then we have taken action. So those two places we might need to spend time but rest 95% should go smoothly like as it is.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So, so when Ashid is back, I'm just is this process pretty straightforward when it comes to uh renewals and refills for a moment? Let's forget about this CSS and other things, right? Is it uh is that our understanding mur correct that as you get into the refill and renewals you're seeing a list of patients where we are supposed to see whether all the protocols are good. Yes, all the protocols are good. then pick it up. Um and uh um if if everything seems to be good, pick it up and send an information in case of renewals to the pharmacy. In case of refills, we don't know to whom we are supposed to send.  
   
 

### 01:21:04

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** For a moment, we will assume again in this case also pharmacy. Uh that's super happy path, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** But in case of it not being having an issue then for renewals it can go to the exception queue. exception Q. Somebody works them out um and then it comes back to wherever it needs to  
**Arpit Jain:** H.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** come back. And u so this whole concept of what we were thinking about pharmacy switch and other things should we even think through or or is it are we for MVP we should not think all of  
**Arpit Jain:** No that is that no we  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** these things right now.  
**Arpit Jain:** might correct correct you're right for we might not think about that maybe for the cost barrier for the barriers we might not think like because all these things ideally would come into the barrier after we make an outreach or like after we escalate something like once our pharmacist and everything everyone does their job if we are uh after that if we are facing any issues uh like cost transport, pharmacy switch, all those other things that we can take it off maybe and we can just keep the clinical cues like whatever the AI whatever they are checking like the EMR and the uh claims and other places protocols that that we can include maybe because that is common uh and it would be valid both for refill and renewal uh and just just the only difference  
   
 

### 01:22:37

   
**Arpit Jain:** is going to be for refill 99% will go for renewal might be some percentage it will not go. Happy birth  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I'm possibly not convinced.  
**Arpit Jain:** and also if the team is same I I was thinking maybe the outreach is a separate team. I didn't know like uh like there would be a different team for who will be calling out the patients because the thing which I read somewhere Neil was that uh they they have two type of outreaches like one is uh where the staff calls and one is where the clinicians call for any clinician issue clinician itself calls but for  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** that I understand that anything which is in in escalation queue that's where the technicians are getting  
**Arpit Jain:** any  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** involved anything in the outreach there isn't any anybody going to  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** be  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh it's it's a gentle reminder and like make sure you pick up your medicines on time and why why have you not picked up your medicine on  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** In fact, when we did the first version of it,  
   
 

### 01:23:53

   
**Arpit Jain:** time?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** if you see actually I did not uh differentiate uh what do you call I hate this one.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** We should well it should automatically go when  
**Arpit Jain:** Once we share  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** switch if you see my  
**Arpit Jain:** this  
**Prashant Singh:** option to get rid of it.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** past  
**Prashant Singh:** So I'll explain that later. It will stop coming.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** when I started doing this I never had this monitoring right later I brought the monitoring in to the point I figured out that see here refill pick up an exception.  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** This is how I had right.  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Um  
**Arpit Jain:** But I think I think I think where it was done Neil was that if in case we reach out and we  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I  
**Arpit Jain:** move to something we we need to move out something from outreach. So we need a place.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Hey guys.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. Hi.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Sorry.  
**Arpit Jain:** I  
**Harshith Ramesh:** All right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Sorry about  
   
 

### 01:25:13

   
**Arpit Jain:** no  
**Harshith Ramesh:** that.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh sorry I was just hash just just then  
**Arpit Jain:** issues.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I mean you saw the flow which we spoke about right hashid all we're talking about is uh something coming through the cube uh there is these validation checks are happening um basically your protocol checks are happening then from there somebody's going to approve  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Mhm.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** it and once it gets approved if it is renewal then uh then goes to the uh RX gets generated. It goes to the pharmacy. Um after it is RX is approved goes to the pharmacy. In case of the refill uh if it is approved uh it just goes just goes for a monitoring of that pickup.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** That's I mean that's what I'm not sure of.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Is that our understand?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I don't know. That's where you just have to double check. But I think that's right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think you probably I'm trying to think for me as a patient when I have a refill I need to call the pharmacy and ask them to do the refill right  
   
 

### 01:26:19

   
**Arpit Jain:** Yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** and so wonder here is the meth is the uh process where the  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** clinician or clinic calls on behalf of the patient to do the refill I don't know. We'll find out. I don't know the answer to that.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I I just have the email. They'll get back to us pretty quickly.  
**Arpit Jain:** Sure.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay, I  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** should  
**Harshith Ramesh:** think about the renewals piece only right now and then we'll come back to the refills. But I think it'll be pretty similar.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. I  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think I don't think it'll be too much different.  
**Arpit Jain:** agree.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Good.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah but Hit do you think we are little overdoing in terms of what we have created like a barrier queue and too much thinking about this pharmacy uh switch and other things or you think we are in the right directions per se in the way we are taking  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Let's come back. Let's come back to that.  
   
 

### 01:27:15

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** reduction.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Let's finish up the happy path and we'll come back to that.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Good.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** sure.  
**Arpit Jain:** Oh yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Just a second. Actually,  
**Arpit Jain:** Oh yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I'm going back to the Yeah, I should  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Now on the happy path then let's talk about renewals only.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I'll come back refills like another day maybe. Right now let's talk about renewals only.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Um it gets sent to the pharmacy or gets RX gets written and now you're in the fills. You're in the pickup you're in the pickup queue right? So what we need to when you hit approve the question is when we hit approve here what happens like how do  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** we technically how do we get that script written is what we need to figure out.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So when you hit approved, it is going to go into the pickup queue automatically, right? A it's going to move from this to here.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yes.  
   
 

### 01:28:12

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** But you also need the script in the EMR to be written,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct. That is a very good question. And yeah, and that needs to be confirmed back also to here somewhere in the details that uh in the history that it was also written back on this particular date so that we know what had happened when so that we can then follow it up for the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I don't know if I don't know if I think this could be picked up in our in our um when I say this the fill history that can pick be picked up in our EMR API uh integration right or connection because all  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Repeat.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** This data right now is coming primarily from the EMR, right? Right. The raw EMR is coming from there, right? We need some sort of API connectivity to ECW. So that means when we re when we update that,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** it should be able to come back cleanly. Let me share. Hold on.  
   
 

### 01:29:19

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Um,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** so I was looking at something they had sent me. Somebody had sent me. Hey Jamie Barara.  
**Arpit Jain:** So, hash like how do they do it right now? Like do they go into the EMR and create a new RX new and uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, exactly.  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Exactly. Sent you I can uh claim e prescription from ECW. Let's see. looking at something. E prescriber. Yeah, this is No,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** another sorry hash is it as simple as this we said harsh is it for example uh Smith Robert I  
**Harshith Ramesh:** there's  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** like just go and hit approved here uh I know this is a wrong example for example I should say something which is approved here I'm just saying approved here Ashit uh when I hit the approved the RX gets automatically created and are we supposed to put it in another queue like uh uh the prescribers queue for it to get signed off and then it comes to pick up hers or we should just say as this is approved this is moving into the pickup queue.  
   
 

### 01:31:11

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Let's say let's assume that for now. Here, let me look at this. Hold. Let me send this to you guys. Um,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** do you have an email from me? I think I forward it to you. See, it's called left order  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** let me see this  
**Harshith Ramesh:** this.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** one.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** No,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Are you  
**Harshith Ramesh:** he hold on. Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** seeing  
**Harshith Ramesh:** this is uh I sent you November 5th. I sent an email. It's called uh med adherence plus refills follow-up. Is it title? Med adhere med adherence plus refills followup, I think. Yeah, right there. Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** This one  
**Harshith Ramesh:** exactly. So, now go there.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Look at image six and seven. So, that's you find it.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** it's coming.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** And look at image six and seven. That's in ECW how they write new prescriptions.  
   
 

### 01:32:19

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Let's see.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Apologies for the delay. I have attached the okay  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, just go down. Go down to image six. The attachments.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** screenshots.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** See the attachments? No attachments.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I'm not able to see attachments.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Going forwarded again.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh I put some hard  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Let's see. Yeah, attachments are here. Ignites.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** are you able to see  
**Arpit Jain:** you go. Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** that  
**Arpit Jain:** I was able to see if you go to the bottom most part like Neil you'll be able to see.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** you want to share a  
**Arpit Jain:** I can Yeah, I can share. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Sorry.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I'm not able to see my  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh yeah this one.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** sh  
**Arpit Jain:** So this is the one right  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Exactly. So I'm just looking at this uh verify M.  
**Arpit Jain:** like  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay. So name What is this match e prescribe?  
   
 

### 01:33:47

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** So click here in renewal request for approval. Okay, so this is a request that came in for approval. Drug name, formulation. So I don't know when they get this. Let's say response request. Okay, let's see what I know what that is. Let's do this.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** last. Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Anyway, so I feel like we need to somehow figure out how to get this back into the EMR on send RX and next prescrib approval actually from Johnston. All right. Anyway, so we need to figure out a way to get this back into the EMR to be able to write the prescription, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes, I  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** should.  
**Prashant Singh:** function if if you're going to get an ability to interact with their ECW then there is a function or an API that we can use to submit this back or their version yeah create request or something like that yeah that  
**Harshith Ramesh:** There is. Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** we can use just that obviously we would need uh those kind of accesses and also to get the data there is an option for bulk export that we can do and then there is uh something called subscribe that we can use to keep getting the data whenever there's something changing.  
   
 

### 01:37:46

   
**Prashant Singh:** There are a few more things I actually wanted to discuss in terms of deployment but probably I'll I'll come later  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Try  
**Prashant Singh:** maybe finish some things and  
**Harshith Ramesh:** looking at something.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** No hash I was just just staying in the same question where I started. instance once somebody is going to approve this we are assuming right now that it's as approved by the prescriber also and the RX has got created and for a moment I will think that the systems are integrated it is going to go and uh in a happy path then it is coming up to here in the pickup just see  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** whether once this is approved I'm going to monitor in the pickup for I I have informed this to pharmacist right Ashit in case of the renewal um and uh because I've sent the RX to the far am I supposed to send the RX to the pharmacist right this right Ashit am I supposed to send it even to the member  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So I mean I think what do you mean I don't think it's in the arc of the member I think you send to the pharmacy I think through the ECW through ECW goes to the pharmacy and then I think you remind or inform the member hey your  
   
 

### 01:39:19

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** refill is ready for pickup or your renewal is ready for pickup.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Understood. Do do the me member don't have a copy of their uh RXR ship?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** They don't need it first.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** They do they don't Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** They don't need it. Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I'm sorry. In India, we take the copy. That's why I kind of lost you.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** exactly.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Um, okay. They don't need it. Okay. Um, all right. So all those ones are exception or going to be only those cases where when I'm in this queue when if it is should I say anything which is denied should all come here archit or um all should hit the exception queue or  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, that's a good question. So,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** only  
**Harshith Ramesh:** let's think about why you're not in the happy. Okay, just finish out the happy path. We need to figure out how to you hit approve, it hits ECW and the refill gets written or the script gets written sent.  
   
 

### 01:40:29

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** You can move to the pickup queue here. And inside the pickup queue,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** there is based on the medication, based on priority rating, a very specific outreach protocol, right? That can get defined.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Um trying to  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** think anything else here and there's going to be some AI chat bots or SMS automation and then some escalation to either voice bots in the future or manual human calling, right? And so this work list needs to be kind of set up as both sort of your monitoring but also your work list of like what you need to do,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Um and so the views here I think will be like both days outstanding you know 0 to three or 3 to 7 whatever we had but also a view where it says um human action needed I guess meaning like voice voice outreach. So now I can on voice outreach.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I see my list and I can start working through it  
   
 

### 01:42:00

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. I I see the list of what have happened in the past when the SMSs have gone and other things and I start working on it. Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** because you think about other than what I need to call everything by definition just monitoring right as a human it's just monitoring.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Even if there's AI chatbots reaching out, I'm just monitoring, right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So really, there's a couple different  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So my question was that is where I was just asking that's the reason I created the monitoring as a separate QR  
**Harshith Ramesh:** views.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** because I mean what am I supposed to uh I I did not want  
**Arpit Jain:** Thank you.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** to confuse that monitoring versus pick up here so that it becomes easy for anybody who's just monitoring go there and keep monitoring all we don't want to put that into this one so  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean I think I think what you do is you put it underneath this as a view,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** that they can Okay. I should Okay.  
   
 

### 01:42:55

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Underneath underneath this as a view just keep it simple.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay. I should Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay, does that make sense?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** And then once the medication is picked up, you keep it in here maybe for a few days or a week just you know kind of completion status and you take it out of here, right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So once it is picked up hers we can take it out from this work list right Or should Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think you take it out from this list.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. And we'll move it. We have a we will have a archive thing also.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So we can have a of everything what is getting closed.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** It's been  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** closed.  
**Arpit Jain:** So a happy part is I think clear hers. Uh just like one thing. So in MVP in this whole thing we will be only be the the issue would be only the integration ECW integration will not be able to send it obviously I think and uh the the communication channels uh integration and everything right so those two things would be the one which can we consider that as like kind of out of scope for this MVP at least  
   
 

### 01:44:18

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** So, so I think for inscope for um for insope for the RX writing to the ECW. I wonder if when we press approve you get like in our app a little something that's easy to copy and paste script. They can then go over to E just copy paste it in.  
**Prashant Singh:** Okay, sure. We can probably check what how does like what are all the  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Understood.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Exactly.  
**Prashant Singh:** inputs  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Check the inputs and give them the inputs easily to copy and paste back in.  
**Arpit Jain:** Shut  
**Prashant Singh:** sure and for now since we're  
**Arpit Jain:** up.  
**Prashant Singh:** talking about the scope or uh when we're going to do this UAT would it be just with the dummy data that we're going to generate or we would be integrating or they would be giving us some real data. uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think we I think it would be great if we can  
**Prashant Singh:** like  
**Harshith Ramesh:** integrate into ECW and get like a limited data set of what they're what they're doing.  
**Prashant Singh:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean,  
   
 

### 01:45:31

   
**Prashant Singh:** So in the in  
**Harshith Ramesh:** let's assume we're starting with just our dummy data, but I want to very quickly be able to be in their environment, be able to show that we can suck in their ECW data.  
**Prashant Singh:** So on the environment thing hers that is where probably want to discuss with you that have explored a bit on how to do that without compromising our IP and that is where probably I went into sort  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** of further break up of what exactly does do we have as an IP. So that is where I mean it came out like most of the logical things that we're doing are like public knowledge like PDC calculation and all things  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** so that obviously isn't IP and then if the workflow probably could be an IP but then the thing is if if any user opening a UI always gets the complete UI in their browser and only then they're able to open. So, so UI is never an IP actually only whatever stays in the back end is is protected and and in the back end we have two things.  
   
 

### 01:46:41

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** One is the these business logics which anyways I guess we are going to either validate or maybe they might optim might ask uh to look  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** at uh so that is one thing so that anyways will not remain private or it is actually not private like PDC etc calculation but the workflow anyways they'll have access to in the UI so that will not be so then the third component remaining is the AI uh model. Now the AI part is where it becomes an IP or when we have actually used some of our old data to fine-tune models and create some sort of uh like refined models but since we do not data harsh uh we are going to be using a publicly  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Right.  
**Prashant Singh:** available model right the publicly available APIs through claim then even  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** that is not an IP we that we have like that is the models.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah. So essentially then obviously the architecture that we will build maybe uh these two three different setup of AI models like validating each other uh somehow if uh that is that could be one privacy thing that we can have and if you want to secure that we can still have all of that in our AWS account and we can say that okay the rest of the application if deployed in  
   
 

### 01:48:11

   
**Prashant Singh:** in optms environment uh whenever it needs uh a patient's information to be reviewed by AI they can still give rest of the information through our to our AI model without giving the member identifier rest everything is given that way then the PHI would still not come out of their infra and we would still get it but then I'm not sure if the process would also involve them auditing our AI architecture as well  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** u as well as the prompts that we are going to use if they're going if they're going to use have a sort of look at our prompts and the architecture then then I guess that is also not  
**Harshith Ramesh:** We lose that.  
**Prashant Singh:** yeah so so from that understanding  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** then uh probably there's nothing that we'll be able to secure from  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** them yeah and that is where I also wanted to  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** like discuss and take your thoughts on do we want to are we not imagining this as a SAS or are we planning to have it deployed  
   
 

### 01:49:22

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think I would imagine I think overall our solutions will be sa will be SAS. I think this first one may not may have to be a little bit  
**Prashant Singh:** Mhm. Sure. Sure. Rashad.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** different.  
**Prashant Singh:** So for this uh then if you're not so because there are some ways through which actually uh we can limit them having access to our raw code of the back end. But that is where I just want to check with Asha. Do we for this UAT because that will be an extra sort of work uh to go to that level of like encryption etc where we keep everything encrypted.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** But I just want to understand if anyways all these things they're going to have access to or they're going to ask us for them to audit then probably it might not be useful to or is it just going to be protected through our contract that they should never copy  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I I I think it'll be protected.  
**Prashant Singh:** it.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think let's assume we protect it through our contract.  
   
 

### 01:50:31

   
**Prashant Singh:** Mhm. Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Good.  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** You bring up really good points.  
**Prashant Singh:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Very good  
**Prashant Singh:** cuz they they would fairly have a simple option.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** points.  
**Prashant Singh:** If you're going to deploy it over there, Rasha, then they would for sure have option to always copy. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Right.  
**Prashant Singh:** And it will not be tough. Uh yeah, because they have the complete UI and the backend logic.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** They are the one who are validating it. So yeah, so essentially the mode that we have is just that that we have the solution built and it's working and we have built it and they have not then that's the only  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Contract. Put something contractionally in place.  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So uh so for the UAT hashid uh it'll be like do you still want to be deployed in their infra uh but  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think so.  
**Prashant Singh:** with  
**Harshith Ramesh:** What is a way to not deploy in the in their infra but keep not take PHI?  
   
 

### 01:51:34

   
**Prashant Singh:** Um that would be for AI model. As I told you, we can still have it in our side and we can ask them to send a request without a member identifier because each request will be per member. So our model will know that all the data and information it has is just for a single member. It can still give an output but for other than that the entire back end if you're deploying there  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Mhm.  
**Prashant Singh:** I mean there's no way that we can deploy it in our side actually uh because uh essentially we would have to have it on their side. Yeah cuz it's back in Yeah, it'll have to be on their side. There's a way to encrypt hash but but that wouldn't be too strong.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** I would say the back end also they can put efforts but that is where the question was that would it be really uh like helpful if they're going to anyways audit or give us the the logic themselves or validate our logic. So that is the  
   
 

### 01:52:52

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay. Think about  
**Prashant Singh:** h sure sure and so the the headless  
**Harshith Ramesh:** that.  
**Prashant Singh:** EHR that I was telling you it is also essentially similar to the firebase that  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** uh you had like it has its own cloud offering as well as it's open source so we can also deploy either in our infra or optins infra but for this First client optimum you are seeing that we have to deploy it in their infra then obviously we cannot use uh medplum the headless are their cloud we have to so we'll build it um u like a standalone infrastructure which can be deployed in any AWS account so we'll be ready to do that but then I should if at the time if you think even the UAT I mean obviously if UAT is fine to be done using dummy data then we can have it deployed in our side and they can open our uh tool and they can go through everything the workflow and everything with the dummy data. But if you think even the UAT also probably you want it to be deployed in their infra with their real data then probably we can package everything to and then we can give them hand over and they can deploy or like how do you envision on that part like in terms of tech technical feasibility it is possible for us to package and hand it over to them the entire uh deployment uh script as a code and all they would need to do is just hit a couple of commands and it'll be deployed and then we can give them  
   
 

### 01:54:27

   
**Prashant Singh:** instructions on how they can integrate it with their ECW and they would the moment they integrated with ECW they'll start sort of seeing the data and the workflows but then obviously they have so in terms of technical physibility it is possible but if  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** obviously it'll be first time so there might be some issues they might encounter but then in such scenarios how do you envision Ashett um we interact or and also what are your thoughts or like they would they would obviously want to do a complete audit or something with before integrating with their real data. So your thoughts on that? How  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. I don't know is the answer honestly.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** just but I'm sorry I'm just pulling back to the focus on this workflow  
**Prashant Singh:** Sure.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** first so that uh yeah I'm sorry about getting I  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** Sure. Turn. Sorry.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I understand deployment but right now I But if you're not still clear of this uh I don't think we will be able to reach there.  
   
 

### 01:55:34

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** All right. Uh so I'll be just like one more time happy path somebody is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** approving here the RX is getting created somebody can copy that and paste it in the system so that uh this goes into the pickup and from pickup we start monitoring it um SMSS or whatever it is the protocols we will uh based on the criticality of the client it keeps going there and uh uh and from there uh uh it it once it gets completed it moves into the arcade. Is that right Harshit for renewals right  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, that's right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** now?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** And then we're talking about exceptions, right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, I I'm going to go there harsh.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So whenever we are first of all looking at once which is like pure vanilla so I'm approving it. Um so the system itself there are two cases here rashit one the system itself is saying this is denied um so what happens in this case Ashit should we say it is to what happens here that's where I I'm just trying to understand should we just say it is denied too early fills missing priority prescription approval required clinical concern so if you're going to say it clinical concern does it mean that it goes to the exception queue here hers and somebody from the clinician team is going to work or what is that you're thinking about it hashid I will I will tell you what the way I thought about it before you actually tell anything the way we I thought hashid everything which is which  
   
 

### 01:57:12

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** is approved comes up here and uh approved or denied or pending right hashid comes up here um or okay let me let me correct myself first anything which is approved which is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** like super clean um comes up here and somebody is approving it anything which is pending or denied automat exception screen because whenever we are saying it is pending possibly it is it is the system is not run or anything like that so it is coming up as an exception to me. Second, it is denied. Denied because of one of those protocols have been missing. So it needs either it a clinical review or there could be something else a PA review or anything like that. So that is why it is in in in denial mode. So everything and anything which is like denied or it is EI not performed its job comes up here. That's what I felt. And once you make the respective corrections here, it goes back to your pickup queue or it can go back to again to your refill here to kind of rerun the AI.  
   
 

### 01:58:42

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh, and then it goes back to the pickup queue. This is how I thought about it. Hashid,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** but just wanted to discuss that.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** look, I'm thinking Beth, if you go back to the refills tab and look at the protocols, I'm guessing anything that's where a protocol is denied or rejected um and then the user agrees with it needs to be worked in a  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** different way than the happy path, right? And so let's say the most common one is last visit window wasn't met. So it needs to be within 12 months or six months.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Then you essentially need to go to a separate queue where you're scheduling that patient to come back into the doctor's office. Right? So I wonder now do you let's just take that scenario.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** You take that go to the exceptions and now in exceptions you know you have to work it to get that person  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** scheduled.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
   
 

### 01:59:38

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So if I can explain that, let's take this example. Hit last visit within Windows 12 took six 6 months.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So the moment the systems has denied this for this reason what I was just thinking is Arshett it comes directly to this exception queue and says a status called  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** scheduling right you are supposed to schedule it now somebody from the clinical team is calling and saying  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** hey you did not do this and why don't you come to the office do whatever so that process is happening and once that process is getting completed it moves back to the refill here once everything is done it comes back here  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** so that now that's where I wanted to ask this another question hash so let's take the same example that last visit within windows 12 months comma 6 months so which means it is coming  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** here I am I am the scheduleuler I called somebody hashid picked up the line I said hashid you have to come uh to the hospital and and see the physician or whatever it is.  
   
 

### 02:00:39

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So you come to the hospital hashid you see the physician now now uh you again have uh informations what is required how will this information again come back to our system hers are we supposed to yeah am I supposed to  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** download and again upload into the system or it comes automatically how will that information come back to me to know that okay exception is somebody has already reached They have come and the system has to come back to its original shape here to rerun this AI. Aid that loop I wasn't sure  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** hash.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I'm thinking about that. So if you if I get scheduled once I get scheduled come back next come in next week where am I sitting for that one week and then how does that prescription get  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** refilled?  
**Arpit Jain:** So basically until and unless I see a scheduled visit within the 6 days or 6 month window or 12 month window I can't proceed right the only I trust information I'll trust is the EMR so until that visit happens I won't be able to move forward that is one thing right so that will remain there on the exception and with a status uh scheduled like visit scheduled  
   
 

### 02:02:18

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. But after that what happens right somebody has come then what happens?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** uh do we get the EMR again informing that this somebody had visited and then it goes back and automatically reruns? How how are we thinking  
**Arpit Jain:** I so hers like if if person is visiting a particular patient is visiting a particular  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** about  
**Arpit Jain:** doctor uh Does it happen that every time a new prescription is going to be generated uh for every visit? If that is the case, we can just go ahead and cancel this or like move it to  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean I want Yeah. What I'm thinking about is for MVP is it just unable to unable  
**Arpit Jain:** uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** to refill or unable to and then you go to this list and it gives you a  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** reason type and that gets worked offline as MVP.  
**Arpit Jain:** Perfect.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** That's where that's where both me and Neil have been breaking our head because we asked we we asked Claude what all things are possible and it's like 100 things are possible.  
   
 

### 02:03:25

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Thanks.  
**Arpit Jain:** So we were just thinking how to close loop everything because everything has to be closed loop right.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh so that's why we we were getting more and more confused basically like how should we close?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** process and then basically the reason is whatever these protocol denials  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** are and then and then you make a kind of smart list where you can like filter by  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** stuff, but it all gets worked offline and we can talk to them about how to clean that up later,  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Arpit Jain:** And once I click on resolve or like something like just click on resolve and it will basically either move to archive based on what how it is resolved or like the initial  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** work.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So then we don't even want this exception as a Q right should we I don't know I was  
**Harshith Ramesh:** for now I think. Yeah, I think it's unable to process,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** saying yeah and  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** uh yeah with some status right Ashit we should just push it I don't know should we push it again  
   
 

### 02:04:32

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** into pick up again to say that these are statuses which have moved here and this is what it status means. uh and we can possibly put something here similar to SMS or anything like that one status bar to say  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** that this means it is already to be done offline or right makes  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** sense to  
**Arpit Jain:** That solves a lot of our problem actually.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** me  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Sure.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** sense to me Um  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Harsh when you're I'm sorry if my question looks very stupid here Ash Harit and and don't mind me asking you this like this but for renewables  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** uh um do you See um uh do you see which ones are critical and which ones are not critical? to Harsh because renew is like you're coming for the first time right Hashid uh I'm just pretending like uh why would you say any patient is critical or why would we look at anything like salvage or anything like that Hashid here because I can understand that for the refills makes sense because you're looking at at the PDC and everything but am I missing anything or I'm I'm misunderstanding anything here Ashid when it comes to renewal this is going to be all renewal list here right Ashid Is there anything called critical or non-critical when it comes to animal  
   
 

### 02:06:19

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think for medurance, right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** hers?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** For many adherence, would it be you'd have different prioritization based on gap days etc.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, but I  
**Prashant Singh:** I think  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** do not am I am I understanding this correctly hers?  
**Prashant Singh:** uh  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** was uh I was just reading a I don't know I I was just understanding this again my understandings are more from the reading Ashid uh adherence is more towards the refills right Ashid not towards the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** But you may have a adherence where you have a medication they only give you three  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** renewals  
**Harshith Ramesh:** refills, right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** correct  
**Harshith Ramesh:** And so now three refills is done. You need to rewrite the script,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Arpit Jain:** So B basically we have to work on everything just that when it will come into the queue  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** correct.  
**Arpit Jain:** and how it will need need to be prioritized that will depend on the  
**Prashant Singh:** Good.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** urgency.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Whether you start working on it on it two days before, seven days before, 10 days before, there'll be a difference.  
   
 

### 02:07:49

   
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah. Regardless of if we renew one time or multiple time or no times uh their  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Understood.  
**Prashant Singh:** other will get impacted right uh if they do not uh have the medicine for all the days throughout the  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** No,  
**Prashant Singh:** year.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I I was just reading it. It was telling me that aderance gets more affected when it is on the refills and when it comes to renewals there is a little leeway the CMS gives you when it comes to the point where it is getting renewed. So um because you're supposed to go to the doctor, you're supposed to still visit him,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** get the new prescriptions and so there is some leeway the CMS gives you from the adherence point of it. Uh so that's why I was reading that it says adherence is more indirect. uh for renewals the adherence is more indirect and for refills the adherence is more direct and that's  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Heat.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** why the pharmacist are also expected to manage the adherence for the refills and that's where they're also forced to keep contacting the client and they also keep sending SMSs to client for them to come and pick up the uh  
   
 

### 02:09:00

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** pick up the medicines that's my best understanding and that's one of the things which I wanted to also check with you is harsh when we are talking about SMS going all to the  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Heat.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** uh u to the members um we sending SMSs would that make any confusion in the systems or other I I don't know I'm I'm again overthinking  
**Harshith Ramesh:** We'll think about that later. We'll think  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** here yeah we should yeah yeah  
**Harshith Ramesh:** about.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** okay sure Ashid I I kind of understood this more simplified for us and good for  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Harsh you spoke about medicine compliance check right Harit did I understand this correctly that when you say medicine compliance check I'm sorry I I I don't want to jump but just wanted to check here a you just thinking that did Neil take the pills correctly  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Take the pills. Exactly. Are you taking your  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** um yeah okay so Harsh I I kind of  
**Harshith Ramesh:** pills?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** understand renewals but are we missing anything hashik do you think we should talk about any other scenarios I I think the scenarios are very clear when it is clean we are approving it uh uh  
   
 

### 02:10:18

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** RX created we're copying it and pasting it in case of anything which is denial or anything else then we're going to put those statuses and we're going to push them somewhere here everything is going to come to the pickup queue uh whichever  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** is uh uh a green line uh then it is very easy for us uh uh we have to start monitoring them start sending SMSs the based on the criticality of somebody and whichever is the red line it stays here uh no much action needs to be taken further uh and that's what it is on on the radial  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Correct. I think that's right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** surface makes sense super good I  
**Harshith Ramesh:** That's right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** understood everything Ar any questions for  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, that's  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** you? Yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh, no. I think we covered almost everything.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I got it.  
**Arpit Jain:** So, yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Har just thinking about refills in the same line. Um is should we follow the same protocols harsh if everything seems to be  
   
 

### 02:11:26

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Let's wait. Let's wait till I hear.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** good?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Let's wait until we hear back from them.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay, I'll hear that.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Got it. Got it. Cash retal seems to be very clear for us.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Very good.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, I'm very  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Trying to think what else.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** happy.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Um,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Um  
**Prashant Singh:** I just want to check uh for checking the drugtorug interactions uh and all those kind of safety we shall have  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, good point.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** wait.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I mean sorry before  
**Prashant Singh:** uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Wait until I don't think drug interaction needs to be MVP.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** that  
**Prashant Singh:** okay  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Ashit is this is this part of MVP Harit if Smith and Smith are having MAH and MAC but uh something is coming for renewal for both of these things in a different date. It's it's possible in refills.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So are we supposed to see that somewhere in this decision box saying that look harsh medicine A is coming for next 5 days but there's another medicine which is coming for next 20 day in next 20 days for a renewal.  
   
 

### 02:12:55

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Should we anywhere club that to show it up somewhere here or I'm thinking too much  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. I don't I think it's a good thought.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** again.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Maybe it doesn't have to be part of MVP, but I think it's the right thought.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Got  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah. And for interaction got it uh sh it's not important for MVP but just want to check  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** it.  
**Prashant Singh:** uh when we are going to implement later uh is it we shall have access to the database like the public like commercial databases or the commercial APIs directly or we expect that client would expose because they would already be having access uh to such  
**Harshith Ramesh:** That's a good question.  
**Prashant Singh:** Sure.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I don't know. I don't know. That's a good question.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Harsh from the barrier point of it.  
**Prashant Singh:** Sure.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Do you think we should be thinking about so many things right now?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Not right now.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Hashid like cost  
   
 

### 02:13:53

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** I would I think you just throw those into the unable to process bucket and then  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** barrier.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** we'll and then we'll learn a lot right through the process.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay. Yeah. Okay. Ash.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Because this seems to be again to me little overkill at in time to start with.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think so.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh I agree. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** so.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Makes sense. I am like super clear.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** is from  
**Harshith Ramesh:** good. Should we go back? If you go back to the MVP for the all patients tab or  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** um just a second I just a second for some  
**Harshith Ramesh:** section.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** reason. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All patients tab.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So I think from MVP do we think we can pull all this information  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Just one minute. It's still coming up.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** in?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I don't know.  
   
 

### 02:14:54

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** A Are you Are you seeing it?  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Are you open and stop?  
**Arpit Jain:** I have mine open, but I think it is.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. I I got it. Don't worry. I got it. A Yeah. Go  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean I think do we think we can kind of accomplish this from MVP like this  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** ahead.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** table.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Uh I Ashit I think so. At just correct me if I'm wrong because this table we kind of worked this out.  
**Arpit Jain:** This is Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** And we are pretty much ready with this one. This is seems to be something we've already worked on  
**Arpit Jain:** This  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Prashant Singh:** And in terms of data arith uh we uh so so since we're going to use this  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** it.  
**Prashant Singh:** headless ehr uh offered by this medplum client so and use uh this very popular and common um member like patients synthetic data generation tool called Cynthia. So it is generating the patient's data and most of the things we we have from that.  
   
 

### 02:15:50

   
**Prashant Singh:** But one of the thing that is missing there is this appointments uh sorry uh the RX u data RX claims data that probably  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Prashant Singh:** will work on generating synthetically. Uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay. And I sent and I just sent you the format of the RX claims data.  
**Prashant Singh:** s\*\*\*.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Correct. I share I think I shared it with you in this Google in this go doc in this Google file.  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah. Yeah. I think I shared last time. I'll make sure that we're generating and there's one resource. Uh so I also wanted like quick five minutes. So just want to tell like because this whole new environment that I'm setting up so essentially this fire based resources so there's a little difference because this is also like at the back end a relational database itself like a SQL uh where tables are there and u columns are there but this fire structure is essentially storing a big JSON in one of the columns and inside that JSON the data is there like a prop like sort of a document DB itself like a  
   
 

### 02:17:08

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Prashant Singh:** and then we have like predefined APIs which are used by the industry and and it's mandated by fire R4 uh compliance so we're going to be using that so it has a little bit of learning curve to start with so I'll just probably try to have most of the things done in the development environment which I'm working on right now but there is a there are a few like tutorial or sort of some guides which I'll share across for all four of us to go through so we're like little uh comfortable developing on this but before we get back to you or should probably I'll have internal sessions among ourselves and we'll try to make sure that we are also confident So when you are also getting onboarded you you're like seeing a lot of progress and a lot of environment sort of pretty easy to work  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. And then just in terms of MVP,  
**Prashant Singh:** with  
**Harshith Ramesh:** so campaigns are not needed, right? You can take campaigns out of out of MVP. And if you click into a patient hopefully, it's not working now,  
   
 

### 02:18:21

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I don't  
**Harshith Ramesh:** but  
**Arpit Jain:** Harshett like before we go to that like on this particular page I I realize that you have changed uh the  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** mind.  
**Arpit Jain:** MSE MED MH on a on a medication level uh not on a measure level not on a medication level and you're the worst PDC right and the fragility is also only for that  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** so should we do that or like should we do that for multiple medicine  
**Harshith Ramesh:** No, it's at the measure level.  
**Arpit Jain:** if okay so this right now is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Not medicine level is at the measure level.  
**Arpit Jain:** measure level and that is how we should proceed Right.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Correct. Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yep.  
**Arpit Jain:** And the last contact which we are seeing on the last column uh that last contact should be inclusive of the refills contacts which we having like one member whatever contacts we have had should we include that or should it should be only specific to the campaigns and this all patient CRM any contact right  
**Harshith Ramesh:** any contacts.  
   
 

### 02:19:21

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Thank  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I don't know what  
**Harshith Ramesh:** you.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** happened.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh you can just autofill autofill demo credentials  
**Prashant Singh:** Autofill demo credentials.  
**Arpit Jain:** above uh above if you see yeah this and you can  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** sign in. Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Hash the campaigns which you're going to create here is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I don't worry about the campaigns yet.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So, we're going to create for MVP. This screen is going to come up clearly, right? Hash and we are  
**Harshith Ramesh:** And I think this and then when you click into the patient,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** pretty  
**Harshith Ramesh:** you have the patient details should come up.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah, I'll maybe open mine when I think this is not okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. So,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I know what happened. I fix that error, but  
**Arpit Jain:** uh so this is the one which I have. Let me remove this from here. Okay. So once we click on patient.  
   
 

### 02:20:41

   
**Arpit Jain:** So this would be a bit different hers like but we can like this.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So overview uh here I have given like multiple things like  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Looks good.  
**Arpit Jain:** uh we can we can see yeah like recent lab results like how the PDC is getting like uh so uh so for for example hers like if I'm starting uh the calendar year and it's  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** only January or February then showing PDC as like uh 5% 10% won't make much sense that time we can actually look at uh the uh the current PDC or like the year-to- date PDC C and on switch later at the later half of the year we can then  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** count that PDC. So that's what I was thinking uh here like we can we can actually change how PDC is calculated based on calendar year rolling 12 months year to date and and those things again some could be part  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** of MVP some could not be so it's just calculations simple so very easy yeah  
   
 

### 02:21:36

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, that's easier. Calculations.  
**Arpit Jain:** that's very easy yes then the current medication list again this is like duplications I'll remove it from here  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** because medications there is separate tab and the tab which you had actually I like that so maybe we'll utilize that tab and not not this.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** So, uh then outreach here again this needs to be reworked because we are actually  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** uh now after refill and renewal and everything this has to be  
**Harshith Ramesh:** And maybe this outreach for MVP is like very simplified,  
**Arpit Jain:** inclusive. Yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes. For now it will be very simple harsh.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yes.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** Like this generate call logs and like the these basic things.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Be very simplified. Yep.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. Basic things. Yes.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** This will be the out which is happening over there is getting informed here right  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh Yes. Yes.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** as  
**Arpit Jain:** Everything have to be inclusive.  
   
 

### 02:22:24

   
**Arpit Jain:** Yes. Yes. Yes. Neil. So, uh this this history should contains like everything basically like renewals everything. Patient journey I'll just skip because yeah for now campaigns also we can skip and  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** metrics is also like here we can definitely show these things and the ones additional you have also on your  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** hardship we can show those things like the history  
**Harshith Ramesh:** The only thing that's great. The only thing is on medications list on mine you have the ability to run AI on  
**Arpit Jain:** this  
**Harshith Ramesh:** ad hoc basis to check for refills or renewal.  
**Arpit Jain:** okay  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So if a patient calls in and says, "Hey,  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I need a renewal for uh amidone." You have a way to go in here and just check it right here.  
**Arpit Jain:** Okay. Okay.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think look at the UI I had is a little bit cleaner I think on this payment but you can look at you can click there and it'll show you the ability to run the AI on  
   
 

### 02:23:24

   
**Arpit Jain:** Sure. We'll definitely check that out. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** it  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh and hers like do you think we should of in the all patients page we should give an option to the user to move something to the refill work list and like renewal work list  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I I think so.  
**Arpit Jain:** uh right like we should give an option  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, if it's not there already.  
**Arpit Jain:** just  
**Harshith Ramesh:** And maybe it should say right somewhere if it's in one of the work lists. Make maybe replace campaigns because is it in the worklist or not?  
**Arpit Jain:** yeah ah yeah right yeah that could be  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Right.  
**Arpit Jain:** helpful  
**Harshith Ramesh:** But the only difference is all patients is at the patient level versus work is at the  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** patient medication level.  
**Arpit Jain:** that's why I had it like the medication level we I was showing because the zero RX 5 RX like whatever refills they have remaining always be at the medication level not the measure  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** level.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** but then maybe it's an option.  
   
 

### 02:24:18

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** It says, you know, you move it and ask and it asks you which medication to move it along with, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Or  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. And we can always do this and show it in a here also if needed basically.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** So  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. I mean,  
**Arpit Jain:** yeah,  
**Harshith Ramesh:** it would be nice if you can like drag and drop it into the uh worklist and then when you drop it, it asks which  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I  
**Harshith Ramesh:** medication.  
**Arpit Jain:** the only challenge would be like how to show her ship like if I have three medications that is very rare but like if I have two medications for the same measure uh how to show here like 0 RX 3 RX one might be having a bad PDC so we'll show that worse PDC thing but another one could be out of met. So that would  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Should we show something like a combined PDC in such cases where we are having more than one  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** be  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** medicines also together to  
   
 

### 02:25:09

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean the problem I mean the PDC has to be at the measure level,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** see?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right? That's what's for star measures and that's all that  
**Arpit Jain:** correct. Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** matters,  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct. Yeah, you're you're absolutely right.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. Okay. We we'll figure out hers like what's the best way to represent other things like work list and zero RX and all those things.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Because I'm thinking about like if you you know say this patient James Adams has three total meds, right? If I was able to drag and drop them into renewal  
**Arpit Jain:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** worklist, I drop them in and then it gives me a little bit a popup and it can be multiple checkboxes. Which medication of these three do you want to submit? put them in the work list with select two out of the three. Then it automatically goes in there as two rows, two different two different entries, right?  
**Arpit Jain:** Definitely definitely I should uh sure and and uh they would also see whether the patient is already there in the work list or not and once we click or hold it it will show for which medication it is in so  
   
 

### 02:26:12

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Exactly.  
**Arpit Jain:** maybe would work here and accordingly they can move the another one to the to the worklist.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Exactly.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. Okay. Sure it will will look into it.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Hash at this point in time we are only looking at this proactive way of working Right hash we are not looking at at least for this MVP are we supposed to look into the reactor way when I say reactive there  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think so. Right. So, so let's say you have somebody calls in and it's not on your work list.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** is  
**Harshith Ramesh:** You want to be able to immediately give an answer, right?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** correct but how are we going to bring it into that workless district that it has come through our  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean, I wonder I wonder if you then go in that's a good question. You go into the patient here, you run the AI on the protocols, you approve or deny it here, and if it gets approved, it automatically goes into the the pickup,  
   
 

### 02:27:05

   
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Understood.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right?  
**Arpit Jain:** the monitoring directly like Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Understood.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Monitoring. Yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** monitoring.  
**Arpit Jain:** Correct. Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** And is the same in case of the facts as well you're saying. So I get the facts looking at it and doing it and moving it.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Okay, makes sense.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I think I think that's right.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So arpit then this part itself we are checking the duplicates and everything right if the way harsh is saying if it is there already in the list and if it is already moved into my proactive then you're going to see already here it is proactive so you don't need to make any actions but if it is not then you're creating it and sending it so we don't need to even see the duplicate check on the  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** later side of it at all right you're seeing everything on on here itself  
**Arpit Jain:** if we do it manually, Neil, then definitely, but we definitely need to keep a track of all the incoming requests, Right.  
   
 

### 02:28:04

   
**Arpit Jain:** So maybe we should park all such requests in some another uh archive duplicate like what I think we already have it. So to keep a track we should have some task  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** created I  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I I don't know but but hashid you you got it right hashid we are just he's saying that whenever we are getting  
**Arpit Jain:** think.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** requests how do we track them whether everything we have actioned it here uh for example we got five facts did I ensure that for all the five facts I see through that it has got actioned and it is moved to the next queue or whatever it is.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, that's something which we'll answer but for at least for our MVP point of clear right we don't need to yeah think about too much on the duplicates and other things this will at this point in time we will be able to take care  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Arpit Jain:** Stephanie  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** of the duplicates  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. How do you feel about that? I mean,  
**Arpit Jain:** Sh.  
   
 

### 02:29:00

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** do you feel like I mean I think let me ask one thing is do we we have a lot of work here that we can leverage and use. Correct. We're not rebuilding everything.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh can you come again?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean meaning we have we've built a lot of stuff already. We're not we don't have to rebuild everything from scratch.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Correct.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Correct. We are not rebuilding anything much from the scratch.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** We going to only reuse the existing one.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Just going to tailor it little bit. I think at least from refills I'm I mean sorry renewals I'm very clear and this screen I think we are very  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** very clear. I think Arpit got this one and I I think I got the renewals very clearly.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay. Good.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So I I don't think we would do too  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Good.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** much.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Sounds good. Are we on a main br?  
   
 

### 02:29:44

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Is this the main branch?  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh no actually this is mine.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** No no everyone what we show was was our own branches we created  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay. Yeah. It's a problem.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** and we we will get that we  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Getting him back together will be hard.  
**Arpit Jain:** yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay,  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** certainly  
**Harshith Ramesh:** sounds good. Should we when should we catch up next?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** that's a good question.  
**Prashant Singh:** on and al also on that integrating it with the the Medplum uh back end  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** that we have that will  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Prashant Singh:** require  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I lost you.  
**Prashant Singh:** uh sorry can you hear me now Arpit okay so I was saying that um all these  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** screens that uh Neil and Arpit are talking so we'll need to map all of these with the back end that we are creating through med plum for that and that is where I think if these nuances are clarified then next was Apit and Neil were going to create a detailed  
   
 

### 02:30:37

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** requirement document so detailed that even if we give those thing and ask claude to start implementing sort of small step-by-step action items I think the work is a lot but if if the requirements are detailed enough we might not face lot of rework work over there and that is where like uh this was like a prerequisite that we shall get uh all these clarified and and  
**Harshith Ramesh:** sounds.  
**Prashant Singh:** have very detailed uh requirements. So there's no scope for claude to make mistakes uh at all.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah, makes  
**Prashant Singh:** So the work is there Ashett but we're hoping that with all  
**Harshith Ramesh:** sense.  
**Prashant Singh:** the there might not be a lot of rework.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah,  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** good.  
**Arpit Jain:** So we'll we'll just onboard these features on the main DB hash like that's  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Perfect. That sounds good. Cool. Guys,  
**Arpit Jain:** yeah  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I should probably run here in a second. I know it's late for you also.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah, actually I just want two minutes of yours.  
   
 

### 02:31:50

   
**Prashant Singh:** And before we conclude just want to check uh Arp and Neil do we also want  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah.  
**Prashant Singh:** to sync anything on protocol logic as well or that's for later or we'll be fine.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean logic to look.  
**Arpit Jain:** in discussion. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. And I think we want the client to give it to us what protocol logic is.  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** I mean ideally is built in a way maybe we can intake it through like an AI engine that can convert whatever protocol whatever protocols we get um basically put into the app  
**Arpit Jain:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right  
**Arpit Jain:** Like we saw that what you have onboarded on the on that like protocols which you have listed uh in the screen itself on theite metr fields and we also saw that  
**Prashant Singh:** Yeah,  
**Arpit Jain:** uh presentation there was a presentation I think for wellmet plus optimum protocol.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Correct.  
**Arpit Jain:** So also we were thinking like if we can utilize that and onboard those  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Correct.  
**Arpit Jain:** uh and use that as uh for MVP.  
   
 

### 02:32:51

   
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yes.  
**Arpit Jain:** So we were thinking that  
**Harshith Ramesh:** That's right. That's  
**Arpit Jain:** yeah  
**Harshith Ramesh:** right.  
**Prashant Singh:** because I should we would need all those details to uh build our AI logic, right?  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Exactly.  
**Prashant Singh:** Uh cuz Yeah. So we  
**Harshith Ramesh:** So I think the way the logic was built now is you have these prompts.  
**Prashant Singh:** do.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** You have like the protocol in one prompt. You have a knowledge base in the prompt and then you have and that's comparing against the EMR data.  
**Prashant Singh:** Mhm.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Take a look at  
**Prashant Singh:** Sure. Sure.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** it.  
**Prashant Singh:** Okay.  
**Arpit Jain:** Uh yeah, sorry you were saying  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** No,  
**Arpit Jain:** something.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** I no I I think I'm clear. uh uh honestly little uh little happy also because after this call I feel much of the downstream process are little simplified at this point in time.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Good.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** So yeah I'm glad we had this meeting because this is very  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Yeah. Good.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** important.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Excellent. Cool. Neil, you want to spend a couple minutes together?  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Harshith Ramesh:** Okay.  
**Neelkanth Kothadia:** Sure. Thank you. Stopping
